# Data-Science-Basics
Data Accessing 

# AIM:
To read the given data and perform data accessing and save the data file.

# Explanation:
The process of retrieving and loading data from its source, whether it's a database, flat file, web API, or other storage system, to prepare it for analysis within a data mining application; essentially.

# Algorithm:
STEP 1: Read the given Data

STEP 2: Get the information about the data

STEP 3: Remove the null values from the data

STEP 4: Perform Python program to access data

STEP 5: Print the derived or accessed data

# output:
The data is accessed through python programming essentially and the basics of data science model is shown clearly and successfully.
